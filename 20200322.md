- Backing up all the disks

  So I spent some time this weekend _finally_ recovering all of the spare
  hard disks I collected during our move **to Texas from New York FOUR YEARS
  AGO**.

  Most of them recovered pretty easily, but one of them wouldn't get recognized at all, both on my
  Macbook or Anna's Surface. I really wanted to get to the bottom of it before trashing it.

  When I tried mounting it as a FAT32 disk (`diskutil` kept saying it was FAT16, though
  a 60GB FAT16 disk is impossible), but I kept getting "0x00 invalid jump" errors. I
  found it interesting that the first bytes of the disk were 0x00, so I tried to
  read the raw bytes on the disk as a file with `dd`.

  This is how I did it: `sudo dd if=/dev/disk3s2 of=/tmp/first_sectors bs=512 count=1000`.
  `bs=512` indicates that each block sector is 512 bytes, but this could've been anything.

  Before I did this, I ran it without a count to see if the entire disk was zeroed-out (i.e.
  no `count` argument). Fortunately, garbage data started to stream; this meant there was
  data to save!

  I first tried `bs=1` to see what the first byte of the disk was (to see if it would give
  me hints about the filesystem I was working with), but it was 0x00. I kept getting the same
  results until I increased the count to 100000.

  Upon looking at the data through `hexdump`, I kept seeing `I  N  D  X`. From searching Google
  about this, I learned that this is the signature for NTFS metadata, which is stored before every
  file in a NTFS filesystem. However, a valid NTFS filesystem has its boot sector code stored
  starting at 900 bytes from the top of the disk...even if the disk isn't a boot disk. Because the
  first few KB were zeroed out, `mount_ntfs` and Windows couldn't recognize it.

  Fortunately, NTFS also stores a copy of the boot sector at the end of the disk. Testdisk can find
  and restore it, so I tried this.

  This took WAY longer than planned, so I killed it during the restore. I'll try again later.
