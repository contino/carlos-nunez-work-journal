My understanding of the Tiger Team:

# Mission

To help migrate apps into AWS to FNM standards within RTO/RPO thresholds.

# Why we are here

To help them create a backlog of work to help this team successfully onboard an app while
maintaining RTO and RPO SLOs, and to provide recommendations for AWS-specific scaling work for SREs
to think about

- Backlog needs to be generated by 2 weeks of the 6 weeks

- Implementation during the remaining four weeks

# SLOs

- Lighthouse app: BRO
- Recovery Time SLO: 15m
- Data Integrity SLO (RPO): Max stale 60m
- Availability SLO: 99.9%

# Risks

- This app does not have a baseline RTO/RPO, so we don't know if the ask is intractable - *Potential
  Solution*: Obtain existing baselines...or add work into the backlog to help the team create them

- We don't know how available the app is today - *Potential Solution*: Get existing % downtime, or
  estimate it from toil in Jira


# Additional Comments

- 6 week engagement
  - 1 week planning
  - 1 week discovery
  - 4 week to show one or two things that we can help with
  - Using the app team's backlog
- Arif's goal: To prove that these apps can be moved into AWS reliability
- SRE
  - Unsure yet
  - Focus is on technical implementation
  - AWS is recommending root cause 
- People

Fannie Mae - Call with Murty
============================

SRE according to Murty
======================

- Uses SAFe
- Contributing on Day 1


Additional Information
=======================

- Went to SREcon
- 50 projects
  - Maybe 40 projects?

SRE at Fannie
=============

- Started at around June
- Cloud operating model prompted these conversations
- Top management promoting "You build it, you own it"
- Today's world
  - Two datacenters
  - Massive prod support footprint
  - 300-400 people
- Want to embed production engineering into app teams to meet this end
- SRE studies
  - Researched 15 large organizations
  - Put a plan together based on these orgs
- Hub and spoke model best to implement
  - SRE CoE: best practices
  - SPokes propagate them to application teamsA

Background
==========

- Cognizant selected to help implement SRE CoE
- Other vendors
  - Accenture
  - IBM
  - EY
- Vendor alley too confusing
- Needed a single vendor that can bring everything together
  - That's us!
  - Our rates were too high, needed COO approval
  - Wanted a single vendor due to timelines
- FNM asked us about:
  - Our SRE offerings
  - Mechanisms
  - Organizational metrics (automation, value, thought leadership)
  - Resources to scale?
  - Accelerators to help scale?
  - Checklists? (because this is what leadership asks for)
  - Curriculum and coaching model?
- They want to use these accelerators to get metrics for every app to see how mature they are 

# Davita

## General

- Stakeholder shifted the SOW from SRE to more tactical stuff
- The SRE work was never realized because of this
- Some artifacts came from it, but it was more tactical in nature

## ROI Value Drivers

- Couldn't get them
- Weren't able to fully deliver a product
- Weren't able to track outages, but now they can
- They have runbooks to respond to production incidents; they didn't before.

## SRE-specific stuff

- Trying to use SRE to create communication between teams
- Lots of siloing going on; tools and processes were put in place to increase collaboration between teams
- Things put in place
  - Runbooks as code for any issues that happen in production
  - Runbook and playbook template
  - Capacity planning/cost of errors
  - SRE bot to perform lightweight error triage

## Organization

- CWOW
  - 70 microservices
  - Changes not communicated to prod support
  - Cross functional teams w/ prod ops and devops embedded

## Tools

- Prometheus + Grafana
- Dynatrace

# State Street

## Organization

## SRE-specific stuff

- SRE center of excellence
- Documentation on what the SRE team looks like
- Production Readiness Review
- Backlog of activities to do
- Omnia
  - 19 programming rolling into it
  - 100+ people
  - Operate in a new way for a new cloud
