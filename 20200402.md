Fannie Mae:

I am struggling to understand what the success criteria for this cloud migration "tiger team" is. I am guessing that we can make them "SRE" by creating SLOs around their cloud migration service (though we will need help from their product owner to do this), but we will need to understand who the customers are, what happpiness is, etc.
Fannie Mae:

We can do "SRE-like" things while we're on this cloud Migration team without labelling it as SRE, i.e.:

- Create automation to provision apps onto ECS (or whatever)
- Provide dashboards tracking metrics around the quality of those migrations
- Compare migration speed, i.e. rate of migration was this before Contino, rate of migration was this
- Fannie Mae: I really need to meet Arif and Carla to put faces to name and get plugged into all of the context happening here.
- Fannie Mae: I would like to understand why engineers are in so many meetings. If I were a team lead, this would be a MASSIVE smell that would need to be fixed immediately.
