- SRE webinar
- Bizdev: Templatized the SRE case studies deck
- CVS: Reviewed proposal
- Fannie Mae: Genericized RET assessment from JPMC Decom project.
- SRE webinar: Got caught on trying to figure out why after ejecting from react-scripts, I could not start the web server by way of 'docker-compose up' but could start it with 'docker-compose run'. Fucking hate JavaScript, Node and React.
- SRE webinar: I had to eject because create-react-scripts assumes that your app all runs on a single page, and the only way to modify the webpack config that sets this is to eject. Again, fucking hate JavaScript, Node and React.
